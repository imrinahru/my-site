Have you heard of risograph?

I was first mocked by its similarity with lithograph, where litho- stands for stone, so lithograph is a printmaking technique using a stone surface that can be dated to the 18th Century.

Risograph sounds serious, but it's not, riso- is name of a small Japanese company that invented this machine.

Add the one about home-owned riso

I can't remember how I was drawn to Riso, but I can't help but feel more enjoyment sitting in a room full of riso prints, inks and a temperamental machine, than with things that only live in screens.

The source of this enjoyment comes from materiality, such as the printing marks, the papers, the inks, the machines that require constant cleaning and maintaining, and of course the final work that can be posted on any surface.

It opened my world to CMYK and printing techniques, as well as that of zines and self-published books.

I loved that my colleague in the Riso studio mentioned that the riso is perfect for her since she can go back and forth between digital and analogue. She would create art work using pen/pencil, scan it, layout and retouch in Photoshop, and print it, so it goes from paper, to digital, and back to paper.

I love that she was deliberately using scrap papers that people have used to find an interesting effect it might make to her prints.

I love that the studio named the machines Gail and Doris.



If I want to bridge the digital with Riso graph, what would be the interesting area to explore? There are some I can think of now:

1. A contents that bridge between digital and material, such as moire (?), pixel art (?). Bringing the digital back to touchable, subject to the real-world, which we usually forget for digitals


> [!NOTE] Pixel art
> Create pixelated color schemes based on an image, change the pigment size, print them and display in a series


2. Contribute to and expand p5.riso, as community involvement and linking communities
