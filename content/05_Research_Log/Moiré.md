# Moiré as an Aesthetic Principle

This research summary started with my readings on Hank Gerba's article in Invisible Culture, and Gerald Oster and Yasunori Nishijima's article in Scientific American.

## 1. Introduction: From Technical Effect to Aesthetic Concept

- **Moiré patterns** are not just technical glitches but starting points for rethinking the **oscillation between digital (discrete) and analog (continuous)** as a **fundamental aesthetic principle**.
- Gerba frames this as an **aesthetics of automaticity**—the sense that images emerge on their own, without direct human intervention.

## 2. Details → Contour

- Perception flips between detail and outline
    - Duck–rabbit illusion → contour persists, meaning shifts.
    - Necker cube → edges stay, depth orientation alternates.
- **Detail aggregation**: many small digital details create a perceived analog form

---
## 3. Oscillation (Multi-Stability)

- Moiré reveals how perception flips between discrete order and continuous flow.
    - Rote repetition (discrete, digital).
    - Generativity (novel, analog-like emergence).
- Examples:
    - Textiles: individual threads (digital) → shimmering overlap (analog).

---

## 4. Digital–Analog Transition

- **Digital** = discrete, countable, repeatable (pixels, threads, tokens).
- **Analog** = continuous, flowing, perceptual (contours, shimmer, sound waves).
- Moiré patterns **emerge in the space between them**.
- They show that digital and analog are not opposites, but **constantly transform into each other**
- **Examples:**
  - **Silk calender machine** → shimmer from pressed threads.
  - **Camera sensors** → digital grids clash with patterns, creating moiré.
  - **Tulip Mania** → virus changes cell structure, producing streaks like “biological moiré.”
  - **Japan** → moiré visible in kimonos, blinds, woven baskets.

References:
- Wilden, The Rules Are No Game: As the moiré effect presents itself as a content of perception and becomes iconic, in other words, an _analog_ transformation occurs: “Analog coding leading to iconic gestalts selected by the perceiver is the basis of body communication between humans . . . Iconic communication in general includes sculpture, music, painting, photography, film, and video. Along with visual icons (the commonest kind) should be included images of touch, taste, smell, and hearing, and icons of orientation in space and time.”

- Mal Ahern, “Cinema’s Automatisms and Industrial Automation”: The profound difference between the hand-drawn and the photographic, I argue, does not have to do with a distinction between human presence or absence, but between the eye and the lens, or between the manual and the mechanical. Rather, it has to do with distinctions between repeatability and variability, rigidity and flexibility, stasis and dynamism. It has to do, most precisely, with the relative presence or absence of dynamic feedback within the image-making process.

## 5. Technical Automaticity

- The capacity of a technical system to produce something perceptually or materially new out of ordered repetition, without direct creative intervention.
- Moiré patterns feel “automatic” because they come from the interaction of systems, not a direct hand.
- This effect happens across media:
    - Printing/photography: dots → continuous images.
    - Weaving: loom mechanics generate patterns

References:
- **Siegert**: cultural techniques like grids organize how we represent space.
  - Moiré patterns often emerge from _interactions of grids_ (e.g., overlapping pixel arrays, screen meshes). So moiré is rooted in the **specific history** of Western media’s reliance on grids.
 - Even though moiré is tied to the Western tradition of the grid, it **also undermines** that tradition as they are _unpredictable_ and _destabilize_ the clean order of the grid.

- **Krämer**: media make things appear while hiding their own role (“transparent media”).
  - “transparency (the diaphanous) . . . is an early thematization of the phenomenon of medial self-neutralization . . . The interrelationship between ‘making something appear’ and ‘withdrawing oneself’ provides a criterion that distinguishes media from related phenomena.”

- **Kittler**: our ways of thinking depend on the technical systems of an era—Technological a priori
  - The multiple is the outcome of specific historical and political developments.
  - The multiple isn’t just about **copying** (e.g., printing press, photography producing indistinguishable reproductions).
  - It’s about a **transductive capacity**

- **Simondon**: repetition can shift from order → novelty (“transduction”).
  - repetition transforms from the grid/code → ground of novelty, an unexpected emergent effect, such as moiré.

- Silver: inventiveness of texture in **weaving**:
  - Texture is “one of ingrained interiors” — meaning that the experience is tied to the internal structure of materials as they are felt or perceived directly.
  - Weaving is a practice that inherently combines:
    - **Materiality** (threads, fibers, physical structure),
    - **Sensory experience** (tactile feel, visual patterns),
    - **Symbolic meaning** (status, cultural identity, design language).
  - Weaving thus serves as both a literal and metaphorical foundation for understanding texture as a mediating, inventive force.

- Galloway refines “the multiple” into two types:
  1. **Formal multiplicity**:  
    - Duplication or copying that leaves the original intact.
    - Example: reproducing an image without altering it.
    - Concern here might be the _uncanny_ sense of copies, but the copy doesn’t change the nature of the original.
  2. **Real multiplicity**:
    - The multiplicity that is **material** to digital computation.    
    - Units like monads, sets, arrays, molecules, cells, crystals — discrete building blocks that form the basis of larger systems.
    - Here, multiplicity is intrinsic to the medium itself, not just an act of duplication.

## 6. Aesthetic Rewriting: Texture and Emergence

- **Texture** connects two sides:
    1. **Material** (threads, pixels, measurable properties).
    2. **Experience** (how it feels, looks, or shimmers).
- **Emergence** = new effects that can’t be reduced to the parts (e.g., shimmer from threads).
- **Weaving** shows how:
    - Material, sensory, and cultural meaning come together.
    - Patterns arise from the process itself, not individual design.
- Thus, texture is not just property but **process of mediation**—a contact zone between craft/computation, analog/digital, perception/technical system.
- Moiré patterns exemplify this mediation: interference generates novelty while revealing the structure behind images.

References:
- **Laura Marks**: vision can be tactile (“haptic visuality”), as sensory contact, not just detached seeing.
  - Marks argues that European post-Enlightenment rationality shifted vision away from this “contact” model toward a disembodied, knowledge-centric model.

- **Silver on emergence**: new properties arise from combinations, irreducible to their parts.

> Thus, in texture, we find the first expression of an aesthetic concept which is rooted in the haptic feedback of textiles and perceptually thematized by watered silk, but which is broadly applicable to any process which seems to mediate, “automatically” through serial repetition on one level and wholistic perception on another, a relationship between strata of technical and perceptual sensibility.

## 7. Art-Historical and Scientific Contexts

- **Oster & Nishijima**: moiré as perceptual phenomenon, scientific tool, analog computer.
- **Artistic uses**:
    - VanDerBeek & Oster, _Moirage_ (1970).
    - Gego’s vibratory sculptures.
    - Henri Chopin’s concrete poetry.
    - Ruth Wolf-Rehfeldt’s mail art.
    - Contemporary: Nicholas Sassoon, Rosha Yaghmai.
- Moiré is both scientific tool and artistic method.

## 8. Takeaway

- Moiré patterns remind us that images are not just “seen” but **made by systems**.
- They reveal how **technical processes themselves produce novelty**.
- By focusing on **oscillation, automaticity, and texture**, we can see how media actively shape what and how we perceive.
