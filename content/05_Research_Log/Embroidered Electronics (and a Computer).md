Project process plan
1. Try different types of stitching on the translucent organza material
2. Understand the basics of circuit board and schematics
3. Design the simplest circuit board
4. Test out a fabric circuit board
5. Expand the idea to 8-bit computer and machine learning demo
6. One layer
7. A layer + an object (just an idea: covering the infamous atomic bomb as both sides of computation)
8. Create a multi-layered silk installation

> ## **The Challenge: Teaching an Old Computer New Tricks**

I decided to implement Perceptrons, the most fundamental type of artificial neural network. Perceptrons are a supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning to classify data with simple binary decisions – perfect for a machine with limited power!

Now, let’s be real: running a Perceptron on an 8-bit computer is a serious limitation. But at its core, AI is just math, and I wanted to prove that you could implement the basic logic of artificial neural networks on even the most primitive hardware.

The goal? To use Perceptrons to model simple logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) – the building blocks of computation.




Idea: 
Mend your house with embroidery
- Create a model house with switches and other electronics rethought
- light switch, a clock, a computer, a timer
