## Core Ideas

- **Self-Exploitation as Absolute Slavery**  
    In neoliberalism, individuals willingly exploit themselves without an external master.
    
    - There is _no master_ forcing the achievement-subject to work, yet it remains absolutely enslaved to labor itself.
        
    - Labour becomes totalized — life and work are no longer separable.
        
    - Capital exploits _freedom itself_, as Marx wrote:
        
        > “It is not the individuals who are set free by free competition; it is, rather, capital which is set free.”
        
- **The Loss of Relational Freedom**  
    The neoliberal subject lacks the capacity for relationships free of purpose or utility.  
    Freedom, once relational and communal, is now individualized and economized.
    
    > “We are being expelled from the sphere of lived immanence—where life relates to life instead of subjugating itself to external ends.”
    
- **Transformation of Citizenship and Politics**  
    Neoliberalism converts citizens into consumers.
    
    - Political life becomes passive — a _spectator democracy_.
        
    - Even political institutions now serve as _“the handmaiden of Capital.”_
        
    - As consumers, voters no longer engage in shaping the community.

## Philosophical and Historical Context

- **Hegel**
    
    - The master’s sovereignty comes from transcending bare life — risking death and living beyond necessity.
        
    - Freedom once implied _an excess of life_, not survival.
        
- **Etymology of Freedom**
    
    - Originally, _freedom_ meant _being among friends._
        
    - The words _freedom_ and _friendship_ share the same Indo-European root.
        
    - Hence, **freedom is a relationship**, not isolation.
        
- **Marx**
    
    - True freedom arises in community:
        
        > “Only in community [with others does each] individual [have] the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions.”
        
    - Freedom = self-realization with others → _a working community._
        
- **Walter Benjamin**
    
    - Capitalism functions as a religion: an endless cycle of debt and guilt.
        
    - There is no relief or redemption, only the perpetuation of unfreedom.
        
    
    > “A vast sense of guilt that is unable to find relief seizes on the cult, not to atone for this guilt but to make it universal.”

## Neoliberalism and the Digital Condition

- **From Industrial to Immaterial Capitalism**  
    Industrial capitalism has mutated into neoliberal and financial capitalism, creating a _post-industrial, immaterial_ mode of production.
    
    - The worker becomes both _master and slave_ — the entrepreneur of the self.
        
    - Under such conditions, **resistance cannot emerge**, since exploitation appears as freedom.
        
- **The Digital Panopticon**
    
    - Social media acts as a new form of panopticon.
        
    - Unlike Foucault’s model, today’s digital inmates willingly participate:
        
        > Digital Big Brother outsources operations to inmates themselves.
        
    - Users expose, monitor, and discipline each other through communication and self-display.
        
- **Transparency as Control**
    
    - “Transparency” is a neoliberal dispositif: it turns everything inside out, transforming all life into information.
        
    - Secrecy, otherness, and interiority are treated as obstacles to efficiency and eliminated.
        
    - Diversity itself becomes a **consumable difference** rather than a political one.
        
    - The obsession with transparency leads to the _loss of interior depth_ and the _flattening of personhood._
        
- **Digital Psychopolitics**
    
    - Big Data predicts human behavior, turning the future into a _calculable and controllable_ domain.
        
    - Freedom requires openness and uncertainty, yet datafication replaces decision with prediction.
        
    - Han writes:
        
        > “Big Data has announced the end of the person who possesses free will.”
        
    - Smartphones embody _digital devotion_—tools of voluntary servitude and ritual self-surveillance.
        
    - Privacy (Datenschutz) becomes obsolete in a culture of voluntary exposure.

## Interpretive Reflections

- Capital should be seen as a **living, fluid, adaptive organism**—a force that mutates rather than merely dominates.
    
- Even the “rich” are not free; they too are subject to the _dictatorship of capital._
    
- The term **immanence** captures what is lost: life lived directly, relationally, for its own sake—joy, care, creativity, and community.
    
- Nietzsche’s declaration “God is dead” echoes here: transcendence is gone, replaced by productivity and performance.
    
- Neoliberal “freedom” is a hijacked version of true freedom—defined not by connection but by competition.
    
- The ideology emerged in an age that underestimated ecological and social limits.
    
    - “You are free as long as you do not impede others’ freedom” assumed unlimited resources and boundless optimism—now untenable.
