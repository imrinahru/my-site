Digital fabrication tools and communities have opened up possibilities for makers to act locally.

- What does it mean to _act locally_?
- How do we uphold _subjectivity_ and _personal skill_ when working with increasingly abstract, automated, and networked tools?

Below is my note on Chapter 3 of the book on _Tools_.

---

## Acting Locally as Skilled Engagement

- Engaging with tools opens access to diverse domains (jewelry, plastics, fabrication).
    
- It's a direct engagement_ with materials, processes, and decisions.
    
- “Workmanship of risk” (p. 202):
    
    - Outcomes depend on **risk, choice, and knowledge**, rather than predetermined certainty.

## Understanding Tools: Parameters, Limitations, and Control

- In digital fabrication, we need knowledge to control as much of the process as possible.
    
- The degree of automation matters less than understanding:
    
    - Parameters
        
    - Limitations
        
    - Opportunities
        
- Machines expand human capability—they do things we cannot—**opening new possibilities for craft.**

## Cultural Lag in Tool Adoption

- Increased tool sophistication → greater cultural lag.
    
- Industrial tools become smaller, cheaper, more accessible—but cultural practices take longer to develop.
    
- Digital fabrication (DF):
    
    - Once niche; now inexpensive and high quality.
        
    - The cultural moment for DF has arrived:
        
        - Individuals can act as “one-person factories.”
            
        - You no longer need full 3D modeling knowledge; machines are proliferating.
            
    - But cultural needs and interpretive practices are still catching up.

## Information Theory and Symbolic Processing

- **Claude Shannon**: quantified information; signals as carriers of information.
    
- **Von Neumann**: showed how information can be stored and processed (Turing machine implementation).
    
- **Norbert Wiener**: theorized social consequences of these shifts; modern engineering preoccupied with the _accurate reproduction of signals_, not energy efficiency.
    
- **Teilhard de Chardin**: vision of a _noosphere_—a global “thought-sphere” layer of the earth.

## Tools for Power vs. Tools for Information

- A longstanding distinction:
    
    - Tools that **transmit power**
        
    - Tools that **transform information**
        
- Computers extend the mind rather than the body:
    
    > A computer, part clock and part book, allows insufficient physical control.  
    > These tools extend symbolic processing.
    
- We must understand symbolic processors not only as tools but as **media**.
    

---

## Medium, Tool, Instrument

- Artifact, tool, and medium are different perspectives on _giving form_.
    
- Instruments assist observation, measurement, scoring—they do not work a medium directly.
    
- Some abstract, sophisticated tools can be _as transparent_ as simple hammers.
    

---

## Mechanisms and Transparency

- All machines are tools in the broad sense; tools are human extensions.
    
- Mechanisms with good fit and high-resolution sensors can feel transparent.
    
- But in machine industry:
    
    - The worker supplements the machine,
        
    - Instead of the machine supplementing the worker.  
        _(Veblen’s critique)_
        
- **Continuous control is central to craft.**
    
- Motorized or mechanized operations can still increase human agency if they support skilled control (as Gustav Stickley noted).

## Technology as Study + Implementation

- Technology has both:
    
    - **Intellectual** elements (principles, engineering, design)
        
    - **Physical** elements (equipment, mechanisms)
        
- Technology is not limited to machines—it is a **philosophy of engineering**.
    
- As Jacques Ellul warned:
    
    >The more sophisticated the techniques, the more people become intrigued by them, and the less anyone cares to focus on other aspects of the human condition less conveniently subject to exactitude and method (...) The majority of books about computers are simply technical instruction manuals. The more time people spend learning about and tinkering with computers, the less time they spend setting goals or applying existing skills. And at a most general level, the more we learn how to do, the less we know what to do.

## Industrialization and the Abstraction of Craft

>  Among the changes wrought by industrialization, none seems more significant than the abstraction of craft.

>  From a technical standpoint the change was a twofold transformation in tools. First, the tools’ motion became machine powered; their control became indirect; and they incorporated a greater conceptual component, which often surpassed the scale of the individual. Next the tools’ very pace and position became governed by independent mechanisms (at which point they no longer fit our definition of tools). From a social stand point, however, the change was more singular: the means of production had become too elaborate, too extensive, and too centralized to be owned and operated by an independent craftsman.

>  This famous abstraction was a near-fatal blow to artisanry, for it quickly moved power from the traditional tool users to the innovative symbol users— financiers, engineers, and factory managers

>   Productivity became best measured in capital infrastructure per worker, as opposed to the skill of the individual worker. Under these conditions semiskilled workers were good enough. So in the face of new abstraction, traditional skills waned.


- Industrialization transformed tools:
    
    1. Motions became machine-powered
        
    2. Control became indirect
        
    3. Tools incorporated conceptual components beyond individual scale
        
    4. Pace and position governed by independent mechanisms → no longer “tools”
        
- Social transformation:
    
    - Means of production became too extensive for independent artisans.
        
    - Abstraction shifted power to “symbol users”—financiers, engineers, managers.
        
    - Skill devalued; machines allowed semiskilled labor to replace skilled craft.
        
- Decline in skills produced:
    
    - Loss of innate design sense
        
    - Loss of workmanship
        
    - Proliferation of cheap objects for consumers whose self-sufficiency had been weakened.

## From Artisan to Consumer: The Loss of Subjectivity


>  Technical change was accompanied by aesthetic and intellectual change. Declining skills led to a loss of innate design sense and a deprival of workmanship. Machine production led to a proliferation of cheap objects, which were marketed to precisely those classes whose self- sufficiency (and natural sense of design) had been debased by the new division of labor.

>  But also during this time, abstract scientific thinking about visual things accelerated. (...) the camera, as we have seen, transformed visual communication; telecommunications freed communication from transportation; powered machinery expanded the range of practical fabrications; and descriptive geometry increased the capacity and predictability of design. Note that each of these four is a germ of what by now has become an element of the contemporary CAD/ CAM system— a new technology with old roots.

> Powered factories took away the artisan’s freedom to own the necessary tools and hire oneself out by the job. Organized labor such as piecework also removed the opportunity to work continuously, at one’s own rate, with oversight of the process. This in turn discouraged practice, involvement, and care. And here **technology struck right at the personal nature of work.**

> Where two centuries ago the middle-class worker lost first-hand artisanry, now he or she is losing first-hand subjectivity.

> This is to say that **deskilling is now mental.** The relief the computer provides from tedious thinking corresponds to the relief machine power provided from strenuous work. Besides reduced physical exertion, we now have reduced mental exertion. Regrettably, just as artisans had become laborers, now citizens became mere consumers. The allegation is that thanks to the pervasiveness of media and the complexity of issues, people are losing the tendency to form their own opinions.

> The deep convictions that universal adoption of information technology will produce universal access to information and a better world for all seem confined to those who have a stake in the technology.

- The 19th century: workers lost _first-hand artisanry_.
    
- Today: workers lose _first-hand subjectivity_.
    
- Automation affects both manual and mental labor:
    
    - Computers reduce mental exertion, just as machines reduced physical exertion.
        
- Result:
    
    - Deskilling becomes mental.
        
    - Citizens become consumers.
        
    - People lose the habit of forming independent opinions.

## Why Studying Tools Matters

- Uncritical enthusiasm for information technology is strongest among those who benefit from it.
    
- We need a “right approach to tools” to avoid:
    
    - Confusion between tool and medium
        
    - Tool and machine
        
    - Manual and digital
        
- A tool requires:
    
    - Personal control of _scope_, _pace_, _focus_
        
    - Machinery merely requires attendance
        
- **Key insight:**  
    _The degree of personal participation determines the perception of craft._
    
    >The degree of personal participation, more than any degree of independence from machine technology, influences perceptions o f craft in work.
    
- Understanding tools helps us rethink production and reclaim subjectivity.
