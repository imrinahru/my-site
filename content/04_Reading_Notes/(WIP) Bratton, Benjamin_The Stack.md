## Overview: Planetary-Scale Computation**

Bratton’s _The Stack_ theorizes planetary-scale computation as a new model of political geography. The Stack is both **technical architecture** and **sovereign system**, an emergent megastructure composed of six interdependent layers—**Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, and User**—that together absorb many of the state’s traditional functions of governance.

> “This book proposes a specific model for the design of political geography tuned to this era of planetary-scale computation.”  
> — p. 24

Planetary-scale computation manifests across energy and mineral sourcing, data centers, urban platforms, addressing systems, and sensor networks. Rather than seeing these as disparate systems, Bratton argues that they form a **coherent, layered totality**—a Stack.

> “It is a scale of technology that comes to absorb functions of the state and the work of governance.”  
> — p. 29

## The Stack as Architecture of Power

The Stack represents a **vertical geometry of sovereignty**, replacing the horizontal logics of the nation-state.

- **Layers**—Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, User—overlap to create an emergent computational geography.
    
- The Stack’s **verticality** dissolves clear boundaries between physical and virtual domains.
    
- It challenges Carl Schmitt’s land/sea dichotomy: “The Stack is occupying itself.”
    

> “It digs deep into the ground… tunnels cables across cities… bounces down from swarms of satellites… Its infrastructural profile contains all these qualities of the earth at once.”  
> — p. 62

> [!NOTE] **Grids and geometry**  
>
> Bratton’s description of grids, lines, and volumetric layering visualizes how computation territorializes space. Yet in my view, this remains a **Eurocentric framing**, relying on Cartesian grids rather than alternative epistemologies of interconnection (cf. Tsing’s _Mushroom at the End of the World_).

### **3. Cloud Polis and the Reconfiguration of Governance**

Bratton’s notion of the **Cloud Polis** describes how platforms like Google or Amazon act as **sovereign infrastructures** that manage identity, participation, and resource access. These are not formal replacements for the state, but **de facto systems of governance** with extractive social contracts.

>  "all of these and more are now provided by Cloud platforms, not necessarily as formal replacement for the state versions but, like Google ID, simply more useful and effective for daily life. For these, the terms of participation are not mandatory, and because of this, their social contracts are more extractive than constitutional."

> “The Cloud Polis draws revenue from the cognitive capital of its Users… who trade attention and microeconomic compliance in exchange for global infrastructural services.”  


---

### **4. Users, Interfaces, and the Politics of Design**

Users—human and nonhuman—are **cohered through Interfaces** that synthesize the total image of the Stack.

> “the interfacial apparatus that coheres the human User as an economic subject also addresses nonhuman agents (algorithmic, animal, and machine users) with the same ease, placing all Users on a common plane and shifting the design question for the platform from a design for Users to a design of Users.”

Bratton distinguishes **design for Users** from **design of Users**: platforms actively **produce** subjectivities rather than merely serving them.  
This blurs the traditional boundaries of citizenship, as Users inhabit **multiple, overlapping identities** rather than a singular political subject.

> “the political interpolation of the User never finally resolves into the biography of one single person in the same way that the identity of the citizen did and does. The management of multiple User identities and political positions is less a psychological disorder than the politics of everyday life. ”

### **5. Cloud Feudalism and Platform Economies**

Cloud platforms reorganize economic relations into new **feudal hierarchies**:

- **Central servers** command quasi-autonomous clients.
    
- Power and wealth consolidate centripetally.
    
- “Exit” and “entrance” rights are unequally distributed.
    

>  Most remaining jobs might be related to servicing the automated logistics and warehousing of food packets, not so dissimilar to working in an Amazon warehouse or FedEx routing facility, while the surplus population that has not or cannot exit is largely unemployed and increasingly desperate. 

> “For some the right of “exit” is paired with a right (or ability) of “entrance” to the island platform of their choosing, whereas for others, “exit” is a dead option because they are denied “entrance” into the closed enclaves that they would choose if they were allowed. Without entrance, exit is not a right; it is a privilege (or product). When exit becomes a privilege, one defined by the suppression of entrance, it stops being a philosophical principle and starts being a weapon.”

Platforms operate through extractive social contracts rather than constitutional ones.

>  "For some, the prospects of running the world through a “Sky Club” suite of sovereign private lounge services may feel like a tidy substitute for the messy state of things, but Users without the means to purchase their way in, or whose cognitive labor and attention is deemed not valuable enough to support adequate platform services, are left exposed to the wilderness beyond the bad walls."

> “Cloud feudalism can be understood as a particular distribution of power between central and commanding platform servers and quasi-autonomous, if relatively powerless, network clients as applied to human economic geography.”

Bratton argues that as political and economic power shifts from territorial states to networked infrastructures (“the Cloud”), conflict and design alike relocate to the **interfaces** — the hubs and flows that now structure society. The “center” of power is diffused, and design must navigate this unstable terrain where modernity and antimodernity coexist. The future of these Cloud-based polities is open: they might become new commons or new feudal orders, depending on how we design and govern them.

>  Others have articulated the problems associated with these sorts of arrangements, their deflationary impact on demand-side growth, and their ultimate macroeconomic instability. Under such regimes, platform economics works to monopolize power and wealth into centripetal consolidations of extracted value, such that the ratio of value realized by those Users who collaborate with the platform commons (User platform value) to those who own claims on infrastructural profits (platform surplus value) is grotesquely misaligned.

### **6. Sovereignty, War, and Accident**

The Stack’s infrastructure mediates not only economies but also **conflict**.  
Bratton cites examples such as the 2008 Mumbai attacks—where non-state actors weaponized satellite maps, SIM cards, and digital tools—to show how **infra-technologies blur war and computation**.

**Generative accidents and the “Black Stack”:**  
The Stack’s evolution is contingent and opaque. Accidents, failures, and unanticipated uses generate new hybrid orders. The “Black Stack” represents this **unknowable future configuration**, emerging through recombination and breakdown.

---

### **7. Design, Voice, and Political Agency**

Bratton critiques the “voice vs. exit” model of platform geopolitics. True participation requires **design**, not just feedback.

> “User-redesignable systems are both more resilient and more accountable: no ‘voice’ then without also ‘design.’”

This ties into his larger argument that **computation is a design problem of governance**: how to construct architectures that distribute power equitably while acknowledging planetary limits.

---

### **8. Toward an Ethics of Planetary Design**

 
The Stack is both **symptom and opportunity**—it might evolve into a planetary intelligence or devour its host. Its ethical task is to learn **not to cannibalize** the planet that sustains it.

> “Its ability to mature as a form of intelligence is dependent on learning to not cannibalize its planetary host.”

The ecological emergency, rather than negating totality, **extends** its relevance as an interpretive instrument. Planetary computation demands a new design ethics—one capable of framing relationships among people, machines, and environments beyond the modern state form.

---

### **9. Analytical Reflections**

- Bratton reframes **sovereignty as infrastructure** rather than territory.
    
- Computation does not replace old political logics (religion, feudalism, myth); it **reconfigures** them.
    
- The Stack’s **opacity and contingency** (its “Black” future) suggest that politics now operates through design, protocol, and code.
    
- The model is still **Eurocentric** in its reliance on the grid as spatial metaphor—alternative narratives (e.g., Tsing) may pluralize the account of planetary interdependence.






The dream of a perfect future has often given rise to darker forms — **fundamentalist utopias** that idealize the past, or **totalitarian utopias** that try to impose perfection in the present.
Unlike cities in the real world, utopias are absolute singularities, from a Jerusalem that was the geographic center of the world, to the island jurisdiction of Thomas More, to Theodor Adorno's insistence to Ernst Bloch that the utopian impulse is not that of positive reform, but of complete transformation of the totality of what is, up to and including the apparent reality of death.

Fredric Jameson's quote, repeated often by even those it was meant to ridicule, that “it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.” But is that even still true?

Bratton says that **we no longer live between utopia and dystopia** — we live **inside a tangle of multiple utopias**, each claiming totality, each trying to define the future.

The challenge for designers, technologists, and citizens is to recognize this interweaving — and to design cities that can **surpass or escape** the closed, totalizing logics of these utopian systems.

Attempts to reconcile the performative and symbolic demands of security and the open society within the same architectonic entity, whether a building or a park or a city, means interweaving openness and closedness into a complicated pattern of open and shut, bulletproof glass that makes building skin transparent, massive car bomb deterrents as public art in pedestrian plazas, evacuation corridors that link floors with sculptural public walkways that also sort and filter crowds into firewalled zones in case of emergency, and more.

Sovereignty and governance may **reside not in individuals or parliaments**, but in the **interfaces that connect us**: the buttons, apps, ballots, and other touchpoints through which people interact.

Users are positioned as **platform participants**, not traditional citizens or market actors.

Bratton situates platforms in a long lineage of computational economic governance:

Soviet centralized planning (Kantorovich).

Salvador Allende’s Cybersyn project (Stafford Beer).

Early experiments in automated economy and logistics.

These projects are part of a cyberleftist utopian archaeology, connecting:

Futurism, cosmism, and speculative communism (Federov, Bogdanov, Tsiolkovsky).

Science fiction visions of universal planning and material abundance.

Platforms today inherit both the modernist desire for rational, universal provision and capitalist computational governance techniques:

Market simulation, price optimization, futures modeling, consumer profiling, logistics.

Wal-Mart is celebrated as the ultimate in democracy as well as in efficiency: streamlined organization that ruthlessly strips away all unnecessary frills and waste and that disciplines its bureaucracy into a class as admirable as the Prussian state or the great movement of instituteurs in the late nineteenth-century French lay education, or even the dreams of a streamlined Soviet system.

Walmart's relentless synthetic pricing and production megastructure allows the working poor to afford a diverse collection of commodities from roughly 11,000 stores in twenty-seven countries, but at the expense of keeping them poor.
