> “If cryptography exemplifies a lawful right-hand path for dealing with digital encryption—a scientific method—then _poiesis_ and its interpretation pursue the left-hand path. It is the road of images and their dynamic imagination.”

## Summary of Argument

The text contrasts **cryptography** (rational, lawful, scientific) with **poiesis** (imaginative, interpretive, creative), proposing that art can take a “left-hand path” to engage with encryption not by decoding it, but by aesthetically _working through_ its opacity. As technology proliferates, so does encryption—and with it, deeper layers of obscurity (_Mehr Dunkelheit_).

## Key Ideas and Analytical Notes

- **Aesthetic response to opacity:**  
    When cryptographic decoding is impossible or intentionally withheld, artistic engagement offers an alternative mode of understanding. Rather than seeking to break the code, _poiesis_ explores the experience of not knowing.
    
- **Sarah Myers West’s perspective:**
    
    > “Surfacing and making visible the imaginaries we develop around encryption provides an entry point to understanding the implications of encryption technologies in a networked society.” 
    > 
    > → Art can reveal the _cultural imaginaries_ that surround encryption, making visible what is otherwise hidden within technical systems.
    
- **Three experiential dimensions of encryption:**
    
    1. **Locked in** – A sense of entombment within technological systems; the labor of escaping the enclosure.
        
    2. **Locked out** – The affective frustration of being intellectually excluded from opaque, proprietary technologies.
        
    3. **Locked down** – A confusion of inside and outside, open and closed; the unsettling effects of control and confinement.
        
- **Poiesis and encryption:**
    
    - _Poiesis_ = the act of making or creation at the heart of art.
        
    - The article itself is written in an encrypted style, its form mirrors its subject.
        
    - Suggests that encryption is not only a technical process but also an aesthetic and poetic one.
        
- **Critical question:**  
    How might we “work toward its happening”—that is, move from passive contemplation of encrypted systems to actively reshaping or reinterpreting them through creative practice?
