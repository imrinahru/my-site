> By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism

>  In the traditions of 'Western' science and politics - the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other - the relation between organism and machine has been a border war.

>  This chapter is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction.


>  It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the Utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end.


Three crucial boundary breakdowns
1. boundary between human and animal
2. distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine
3. the boundary between physical and non-physical

>  Their engineers are sun-worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution associated with the night dream of post-industrial society. The diseases evoked by these clean machines are 'no more' than the minuscule coding changes of an antigen in the immune system, 'no more' than the experience of stress. 
>  The nimble fingers of 'Oriental' women, the old fascination of little Anglo-Saxon Victorian girls with doll's houses, women's enforced attention to the small take on quite new dimensions in this world. There might be a cyborg Alice taking account of these new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita jail* whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies.

>  the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies. 
>  From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (Sofia, 1984). From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanendy partial identities and contradictory standpoints The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once. 

> Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement forced on us by the terrible historical experience of the contradictory social realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism.

>  The recent history for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition - affinity, not identity.

"Oppositional consciousness", Chela Sandoval
>  'Women of color', a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorporate, as well as a historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all the signs of Man in 'Western' traditions, constructs a kind of postmodernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity. This postmodernist identity is fully political,

>  But there was also no 'she', no singularity, but a sea of differences among US women who have affirmed their historical identity as US women of colour. This identity marks out a self-consciously constructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of natural identification, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of affinity, of political kinship

>  These taxonomies tend to remake feminist history so that it appears to be an ideological struggle among coherent types persisting over time, especially those typical units called radical, liberal, and socialist-feminism. Literally, all other feminisms are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building an explicit ontology and epistemology.

Instead of asking what something _is essentially_ (e.g. “what is a woman?” or “what is human nature?”), she says we should think in terms of **systems**:

- **Design:** How is something built or arranged?
    
- **Boundaries and flows:** What moves in and out of the system?
    
- **Costs and trade-offs:** What’s gained or lost when constraints are loosened?
    

Example: Sexual reproduction is just _one_ design among many possible reproductive systems — and it has certain costs and benefits depending on the environment or technology involved.

Ideas like “natural gender roles” or “natural races” no longer make sense.  
Now, identity and difference are understood through data — frequencies, parameters, statistics — rather than through essence or “nature.”

→ It’s _irrational_, she says, to call some people “primitive” and others “civilized.”  
Both scientific racism and cultural essentialism get replaced by **technocratic or data-driven** ways of classifying people.

Instead of imagining society as a single, unified organism, new social thought focuses on **fragmentation, hybridity, and play**—what she calls _“experimental ethnography.”_  
Anthropologists and cultural theorists now analyze not fixed “organic” communities but the _writing_ and _construction_ of culture itself.

She then links this to economics:  
Modern capitalism — visible in global finance, export-processing zones, and free-trade areas — operates through **flows of information, capital, and labor**, not through stable, “natural” social structures.

Everything — people, machines, ideas — can be **disassembled and reassembled** in new configurations.  
Nothing is sacred or fixed anymore.

Haraway ends by describing ==two ways of dealing with this world:

- **For managers** (those in power): it’s about _communication systems_ and _information control._
    
- **For resisters** (critical thinkers, artists, feminists): it’s about _texts, interpretation, and meaning-making._
    

Both are kinds of **“cyborg semiology”** — systems of signs and symbols for understanding a world where humans and machines are inseparable.

>  In the age of biotechnology and global capitalism, nothing — not gender, not race, not nature itself — can be thought of as purely natural anymore. 
>  Everything is hybrid, designed, and part of complex systems of information, power, and meaning. 
>  We are all cyborgs — part human, part machine, part story.

>  The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code.

>  ==Communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations for women world-wide. Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments, of the fluid social interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as instruments for enforcing meanings.==

>  communications sciences and modern biologies are constructed by a common move - the translation of the world into a problem of coding, a search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange.  

Comment: This is important to my thesis, since by combining coding with craft making, I want to propose a synthesis of dichotomy that's been falsefully constructed.






### Notes  

Cyborg is born from militarism, capitalism, but it can be an resistant force, rely on affinity on the same project, instead of identity

Holding contradiction, cyborg is building and destroying relationship, messiness

Reconstruct language itself

## 1. Foundational Claims

- By the late 20th century, we live in a _mythic_, _cyborg_ time:
    
    > “We are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism.”
    
- Western science and politics—shaped by racism, patriarchy, capitalism, and an ideology of “progress”—have long treated the organism/machine divide as a site of conflict:
    
    > The relation between organism and machine has been a “border war.”
    
- Haraway’s chapter argues for:
    
    - **Pleasure in boundary-confusion**, and
        
    - **Responsibility in how boundaries are constructed.**
        
- Her project contributes to **socialist-feminist theory**, reimagined in a **postmodern, non-naturalist** mode.  
    It belongs to the **Utopian** tradition of imagining a world without fixed gender or fixed origins (“no genesis”).

## **2. Three Crucial Boundary Breakdowns**

Haraway identifies three collapsing distinctions:

1. **Human / Animal**
    
2. **Organism / Machine**
    
3. **Physical / Non-physical** (e.g., information, code, networks)
    

These collapses redefine what counts as nature, embodiment, and agency.

---

## **3. Cyborg Figures and Global Labor**

Haraway critiques both the technological imaginary and global labor exploitation:

- Engineers of advanced technologies become “sun-worshippers,” mediating a new scientific revolution.
    
- Diseases appear as minor coding changes—biological metaphors extend into technoscience.
    
- The labor of _Asian women in chip factories_, or _women in prisons_, becomes emblematic of cyborg production:
    
    > These “unnatural cyborg women” may become the ones who articulate new oppositional strategies.
    

This reframes global gendered labor as part of cyborg politics.

---

## **4. Rethinking Resistance: From Unity to Affinity**

Progressive politics have historically relied on:

- A fantasy of **unity**,
    
- A return to an “organic” body,
    
- Or an essential identity (gender/race/class).
    

Haraway argues:

- We can no longer dictate reality from a single standpoint.
    
- Identity based on “natural” categories is neither possible nor desirable.
    
- The alternative is **affinity**, not identity.
    

Chela Sandoval’s **oppositional consciousness** is central here:

- “Women of color” marks a _constructed_, political identity based on **difference**, **specificity**, and **coalition**.
    
- There is no singular “she,” no essential unity—only **conscious political kinship**.
    

Cyborg feminism therefore rejects:

- Innocence
    
- Victimhood as the sole ground of insight
    
- Essential ontologies or stabilized feminist taxonomies (radical/liberal/socialist)
    

---

## **5. The Informatics of Domination**

Haraway situates cyborg identity within a global transition:

- From **organic, industrial society** → to **polymorphous, information systems**.
    
- From **hierarchy** → to **networks**.
    
- From **“all work”** → to **“all play,”** framed as a deadly game.
    

This is the shift she visualizes in the _informatics of domination_ chart:

- A movement toward disassembly, reassembly, and global flows of information, labor, and capital.
    
- No category—race, gender, nature—remains “natural.”
    

---

## **6. Methodological Shift: From Essence to Systems**

Haraway discourages essentialist questions (“What is a woman?” “What is nature?”).  
Instead, she proposes a **systems-oriented analysis**:

- **Design:** How something is built or arranged
    
- **Boundaries and flows:** What crosses the system
    
- **Costs and trade-offs:** What is gained or lost in different configurations
    

Identity becomes statistical, informational, or parametric—not natural or fixed.

New cultural theory emphasizes:

- **Fragmentation, hybridity, incongruity**
    
- **Experimental ethnography** that studies how culture is _constructed_, not inherited
    

Meanwhile, global capitalism operates through:

- **Flows**, not stable structures
    
- **Interchangeable components**, including people and machines
    
- **Disassembly/reassembly** as its logic
    

---

## **7. Managers vs. Resisters: Two Modes of Cyborg Semiology**

In the emerging global order:

- **Managers (those in power):**  
    See the world as communication systems needing control.
    
- **Resisters (artists, feminists, theorists):**  
    Work through _texts_, _interpretation_, and _meaning-making_.
    

Both are engaged in **cyborg semiology**—decoding a world where humans and machines are inseparable.

---

## **8. Cyborg Identity and Feminist Design**

Haraway emphasizes:

- The cyborg is a **disassembled and reassembled self**—both personal and collective.
    
- This is the self **feminists must code**.
    
- Communications technologies and biotechnologies:
    
    > “Are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies… instruments for enforcing meanings.”
    

Technoscience translates the world into **coding problems**, enabling:

- Disassembly
    
- Reassembly
    
- Exchange
    

This creates both threats and opportunities for feminist politics.

---

## **9. Relevance to Your Thesis**

Your commentary fits naturally here:

> The translation of the world into code is central to my thesis. By combining _coding_ with _craft_, I want to propose a synthesis that challenges the false dichotomy between the technical and the handmade.

This aligns perfectly with Haraway’s argument that:

- Craft, code, and embodiment are not opposites
    
- Tools are “frozen moments” of social relations
    
- Boundaries between human, machine, and medium are actively made—and can be remade
    

Your project becomes an example of **cyborg praxis**, using hybrid methods to resist reductive, technocratic systems of meaning.
