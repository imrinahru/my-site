John Maeda  is someone you cannot not know when you are in digital design. However I became especially interested in what he says recently, through his [2026 Design in Tech Report](https://designintech.report/), where he explores the shift from UX to Agentic Experience (AX): moving from crafting interfaces (UX) to orchestrating outcomes with zero visual affordances (AX).

It's a new idea and too early for me to make any judgement, but I'm noting down following sentence as a point of inquiry: 

>  as AI acts on human intent directly, we’ll be designing for agents. Not users.

The statement is at least provocative and intriguing, which prompted me to read his latest renewed book, _How to Speak Machine_.

Following is my note from the reading.

---

## Why Computation Now Matters More Than “Design”

- In the book, Maeda argues that _design is no longer the central issue_; **understanding computation** comes first.
    
- When design is combined with computation, the results can feel magical; combining computation with business creates major opportunities.
    
- David Bowie’s 1999 description of the internet as “an alien life form” captures how profoundly computation has altered human environments. Traditional “Design” (capital D) is no longer the foundational language for contemporary products and services.

## Computational Design as the New Design Paradigm

- **Computational design** shifts focus from physical materials (paper, steel, ink) to digital and computational materials (bytes, pixels, voice, AI).
    
- Everyday examples:
    
    - A perfect smartphone photo taken in difficult conditions
        
    - A predictive text bubble from a loved one
        
    - A voice assistant greeting you personally
        
- These interactions require a deep understanding of computing to maximize their potential.
    
- Paradoxically, design is what made computation relevant to everyday life—but computation now sets the terms.

## Responsibility in a Computational Era

- We shape how computation evolves; ignorance invites a “victim mentality.”
    
- Future systems may become self-repairing—“computers removing the bugs we put inside them” to maintain endless loops of activity.
    
- This adds pressure on humans to understand what they are shaping.

## Critique of the “Temple of Design”

- The “Temple of Design” is an ecosystem (museums, galleries, fashion houses, arts schools) that defines what “good design” is—based on exclusivity and hierarchy.
    
- Its members dictate desirability from positions of wealth and privilege.
    
- The author admits affection for this world but asserts that it **no longer aligns with the computational era**.

## Democratization of Style Through Computation

- Silicon Valley’s capital and widespread computational power make high-quality design broadly accessible—as long as it is delivered digitally.
    
- Anyone can now be “in style” via the latest computational products, and users themselves influence these designs.
    
- As with the Bauhaus a century ago, old design philosophies must be shed.
    
- Learning to “speak machine” is presented as the new Bauhaus ethos.

## The Nature of Networked Systems

- Modern software is inherently **connected**.
    
- The convenience of the internet depends on this unavoidable two-way connectivity; it cannot be turned off.
    
- This connectivity also creates a temptation: using “computational telepathy” (data inference) to distance ourselves from real users rather than engaging with their actual needs.
    

---

## Ethical Responsibilities

- Designers and technologists must resist the comfort of sameness and the illusion of perfect knowledge about users.
    
- Speaking machine requires **ethical discipline**, not just technical fluency.

## The “Three Cups of Tea” Story and Omotenashi

### Original context

- A warrior receives three increasingly refined cups of tea and appreciates the final one because his thirst was already quenched.
    
- Ishida Mitsunari’s ability to anticipate the warrior’s needs earns him great favor—an example of Japanese _omotenashi_ (thoughtful, anticipatory hospitality).
    

### My take

- In the context of **capitalism and big data**, the meaning shifts:
    
    - The warrior may have consumed more than needed—three cups instead of one.
        
    - In today’s “personalization economy,” each cup carries a cost.
        
    - Scale this up to millions of users: personalization becomes a system of continuous extraction.
        
- Cloud companies, with access to our data, can “brew the perfect tea”—the optimal experience—while quietly shaping consumption patterns.

## Epilogue

I started my reading with a sentiment of intrigue from the author's Design in Tech Report. The name of the report and his talk felt strangely uncoupled. Through the reading I'm becoming more convinced that his report should be mentally translated as Tech in Tech Report.
