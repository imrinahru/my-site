# (WIP) W5_Digital Theory — Week {{week-number}}


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

### What is real?
- Is virtuality the opposite of reality?
- What is the role of digital technologies in this?
- How do we perceive the real? virtual?

### Context
- Companies have the desire to create another layer of data, sensory experience, multiple spacial experience simultaneously
- Steve Mann, 1978, cyborg, create augmented experience
- Michael Foucault, Heterotopia of Other Spaces, a world within world, we exist in them culturally, like mirror, cemetery, ships, gardens,  layering temporality, spaciality, enter these world with its own rule and boundary
- Escher, move between different perspective seamlessly, there is no primacy, only context based
- Gilles Deleuze, the plane of immanence, both real and virtual exist simultaneously, without there being any assignable limit between the two
- Hegel, the real is horrific, we are creating institution, society and other world to inhabit

### Virtual ecosystems
- Not so much about technology and more the potential of the environments they transport us to
- See more of your world? Is it distracting or empowering?
- Jon Rafman, Berlin Biennale
- Ian Cheng, 
	- set principles, 

### Reality

- Deleuze, The Actual and the Virtual, "Purely actual objects do not exist, Every actual surrounds itself with a cloud of virtual images."

### Virtual

- Groz, "virtual is the space of emergence of the new, the unthought, the unrealized"
- Idea of potential, possibility of existence
- Karen Barad, On Touching-The Inhuman That Therefore I am, virtual particles are quantized indeterminacies-in-action.

### Cyberspace


### Simulation

- simulation: operation of a real process or system over time
- simulacrum: truth that conceals that there are not truths
- Boudrillard: simulation threatens the difference between true and false, since simulator produces true symptom


### Embodiment/Perception


- SuperHot: body moves differently, if you move slow, then the bullet moves slow as well
- disconnection of body/perception


### Modern robotics
