# Creation & Computation — Week 2

## Practice & Studio Work

### Soldering Basics

- **Setup & Safety:**
    - AV loan, soldering kit
    - Use fume extractor
    - Lead-free solder
    - Protoboard & breadboard
    - Avoid overheating sensitive components
- **Soldering Steps:**
    1. Secure components using helping hands or vise
    2. Heat the metal joint (2–3 sec)
    3. Apply solder to the joint (not the iron tip)
    4. Let solder flow, then remove solder, then the iron
    5. Let it cool; joint should appear shiny (not black)
    6. Snip off excess lead
- **Tips:**
    - Tin the tip: add a bit of solder + wipe on a damp sponge to prevent oxidization
    - Use shrink tubing + heat gun for insulation
    - Create strong mechanical connections with hooks or tangles before soldering

### Protoboard & Surface Mount

- **Protoboard:**
	-  Bend legs for stability
    - Heat the pad, apply solder, then heat slightly longer to secure
    - Cover the ring without shorting connections
   
- **Surface-Mount Components:**
    - Solder corner tabs first for alignment
    - Heat the pad first (takes longer), then apply solder to the opposite side
    - Allow solder to wick between pad & pin for a good bond

### Common Tools

- Diagonal cutter
- Vise / Helping hands
- Solder sucker / solder wick (for removing solder)
- Multimeter (for testing)
- Tweezer (with sharp pointy tips)
- Flux (wax like material that helps solder to stay in place)
- Solder wick (for clean removal)
- Desoldering pump
