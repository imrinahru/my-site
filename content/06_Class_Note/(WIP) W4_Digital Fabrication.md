# (WIP) W4_Digital Fabrication — Week 4

![[Abstracting Craft pp.59-81 AC.pdf]]
## Lecture & Discussion Notes

the question is, what does it mean to act locally? How do we uphold subjectivity and personal skill?


- **Main Concepts:**  
  -  **"Yet the symbolic tools, abstract media, and intellectual technologies of our time are not necessarily direct projections of what has gone before."**

- But today's tools—like programming languages, digital design platforms, AI models—are **different from industrial machines**.
    
- They are _symbolic_ and _abstract_: instead of shaping metal, we shape information and meaning.
    
- This opens the possibility that technology **might allow new forms of creative, individual work** rather than just repeating industrial-era alienation.
-  electronic information technology constitute a “Second Industrial Revolution,” as Norbert Wiener called this one as early as 19 48 .
- “Industrial Revolution” is a coinage attributed to the historian Arnold Toynbee,
- Cultural lag
	- New thinking and new tools may go together, but only rarely are an alto gether new tool and an altogether new task invented simultaneously. More often a cultural lag occurs. Usually a new tool is used to do things pretty much as they always had been done; usually a new task is done for quite some time by means of adapting existing tools. Thus invention and innova tion are most often gradual.
- **Important Terms / References:**  
  -  Claude Shannon’s work at Bell Labs showed how to quantify information and how signals carry that information, and John Von Neu man’s work at MIT showed how to store and process information— how to implement Turing machines. Norbert Wiener’s work, also at MIT, suggested the social consequences. Wiener expressed the difference of the dawning era quite concisely: “ The preoccupation o f modern engineering is not the economy o f energy but the accurate reproduction o f a sig n a l.” 
  - Teilhard de Chardin, from whom the above is paraphrased, expressed a vision for a noosphere (literally, thought-sphere) supplementing lithosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, etc., as a new skin of the living earth.2
- **Citations / Theorists:**  
  -  Daniel Bell’s T he Com in g o f P o st-In d u stria l Society (1973), and Marc Porat’s T h e Inform ation Economy (1976-78).

> Practiced mastery is something we crave in itself. Aquinas said that we cannot live well without working well.1Most anthropologists would affirm a fundamental relation between tools and humanity. Deep in our very nature, we are tool users.

>  A computer, part clock and part book, thus far allows insufficient physical control (...) These various tools that introduce abstractions do not so much extend the powers of the body as those of the mind. They are for processing symbols. We use these tools of abstraction every bit as much as any others, because deep in our nature we are also symbol users.

> History has taught that we might do well to divide our tools into those that transmit power and those that transform information.

> we need to understand the symbolic processor not only as a form of tool, but also as a medium.

>  The nature of that material will determine the nature of the tools

> Artifact, tool, and medium are just different ways of focusing our attention on the process of giving form.

> Many tools, especially tools that operate on symbols, do not work a medium so much as they assist observations, make measurements, or inter pret scores. We usually refer to such tools as instruments.

> Interestingly, tools far more sophisticated or abstract can be just as transparent as a simple hammer.

>  In the loose sense that a tool is a human extension as means to an end, all machines are tools, and all tools are a kind of technology, even if in the case of an ancient de vice such as an ax, it is difficult to think of them as engineering.

>  Well-fitted mecha nisms, and mechanisms augmented with high-resolution sensors, may be more than adequately transparent.

>  manual reach and are by direct com munication of his force, dexterity, and judgment coerced into the forms, motions, and spatial dispositions aimed at by him . . . The matter lies differently in machine industry . . . [where] the operative’s work supplements the machine process, rather than makes use of it. On the contrary the machine process makes use of the workman.
>  by Thorstein Veblen

>  Continuous control of process is at the heart of tool usage and craft practice. 

>  some operations that reduce the role of the hand (substituting motorized power for brute-force activity) may contribute to an overall process that increases human impetus. Master craftsman Gustav Stickley raised this same point

>  Technology has a Promethean quality, like the mastering of fire, for study renders skills more powerful than the societal forces that harness them. 

>  The important thing is that technology has both intellectual and physical ele ments. Let us use the word “technology” to refer to the means of engi neering: both study and implementation. If to engineer is to design and to economize as asystem, then to accomplish this takes not only equipment but principles. In other words, technology is hardly limited to machines— it is a philosophy.

> Jacques Ellul in 1964.8 The more sophisticated the techniques, the more people become intrigued by them, and the less anyone cares to focus on other aspects of the human condition less conveniently subject to exactitude and method (...) The majority of books about computers are simply technical instruction manuals. The more time people spend learning about and tinkering with computers, the less time they spend setting goals or applying existing skills. And at a most general level, the more we learn how to do, the less we know w h at to do.

> Here then is the pivotal importance of studying tools. A right approach to tools may help lead us toward more measured positions on technology. There may be not always be a clear cutoff between tool and medium, between manual and mechanized, or between traditional and dig ital. We are likely to explore this middle ground.

>  A tool depends on us to control the scope, the pace, and the focus of its work; merely attended machinery does not.

>  **T he degree o f personal participation , more than an y degree o f independence from m achine technology, influences perceptions o f cra ft in w ork.**

>  we must constantly struggle to rethink production,

>  among the changes wrought by industrialization, none seems more significant than the abstrac tion of craft.

>  From a technical standpoint the change was a twofold transfor mation in tools. First, the tools’ motion became machine powered; their control became indirect; and they incorporated a greater conceptual compo nent, which often surpassed the scale of the individual. Next the tools’ very pace and position became governed by independent mechanisms (at which point they no longer fit our definition of tools). From a social stand point, however, the change was more singular: the means of production had become too elaborate, too extensive, and too centralized to be owned and operated by an independent craftsman.

>  This famous abstrac tion was a near-fatal blow to artisanry, for it quickly moved power from the traditional tool users to the innovative symbol users— financiers, engi neers, and factory managers

>   Productivity became best measured in capital infrastructure per worker, as opposed to the skill of the individ ual worker. Under these conditions semiskilled workers were good enough. So in the face of new abstraction, traditional skills waned.


>  technical change was accompanied by aesthetic and in tellectual change. Declining skills led to a loss of innate design sense and a deprival of workmanship. Machine production led to a proliferation of cheap objects, which were marketed to precisely those classes whose self- sufficiency (and natural sense of design) had been debased by the new division of labor.

>  But also during this time, abstract scientific thinking about visual things accelerated. (...) the camera, as we have seen, transformed visual communication; telecommunications freed communication from transportation; powered machinery expanded the range of practical fabrications; and descriptive geometry increased the capacity and predictability of design. Note that each of these four is a germ of what by now has become an element of the contemporary CAD/ CAM system— a new technology with old roots.

> Powered factories took away the artisan’s freedom to own the necessary tools and hire oneself out by the job. Organized labor such as piecework also removed the opportu nity to work continuously, at one’s own rate, with oversight of the process. This in turn discouraged practice, involvement, and care. And here technol ogy struck right at the personal nature of work.

>  Where two centuries ago the middle-class worker lost first-hand artisanry, now he or she is losing first-hand subjectivity. Norbert Wiener cautioned: “The ma chine plays no favorites between manual labor and white collar labor. Thus the possible fields into which the new industrial revolution is likely to pen etrate are very extensive, and include all labor performing judgements of a low level, in much the same way as the displaced labor of the earlier indus trial revolution included every aspect of human power.”

>  This is to say that deskilling is now mental. The relief the computer provides from tedious thinking corresponds to the relief machine power provided from strenuous work. Besides reduced physical exertion, we now have reduced mental exertion. Regrettably, just as artisans had become laborers, now citizens became mere consumers.  The allegation is that thanks to the pervasiveness of media and the complexity of issues, people are losing the tendency to form their own opinions.
