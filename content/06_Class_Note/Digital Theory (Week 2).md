## Lecture & Discussion Notes

### Main Concepts

- Techne: human ability to make and perform
- Digi: What is digital technology, refers to digits, fingers,
- New media/ Media: by Lev Manovich, when turning existing media to computer based, but we don't call new anymore, because its emerging constantly, 
   - mass media: 1969 first moon landing
   - media culture: communicate instantly
- Cybernetics theory: interaction, inputs and outputs, we are also self-regulating systems, computers are modeled like that
 - [Paul Pangarao](https://pangaro.com/definition-cybernetics.html), What is cybernetics? 
  - all things are cybernetics
  - observer, first-order, second-order loops
  - language, conversation, consensus, responsibility, action, society
  - It is a fractal

  - "Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics are widely misunderstood to be the same thing. However, they differ in many dimensions. For example, Artificial Intelligence (AI) grew from a desire to make computers smart, whether smart like humans or just smart in some other way. Cybernetics grew from a desire to understand and build systems that can achieve goals, whether complex human goals or just goals like maintaining the temperature of a room under changing conditions. But behind the differences between each domain ("smart" computers versus "goal-directed" systems) are even deeper underlying conceptual differences, some of which are captured in this diagram. For example, AI (left) presumes that value lies in understanding "the world as it is" — which presumes that knowing the world is both possible and necessary. Cybernetics (right) holds that it is only necessary and only possible to be coupled to the world sufficiently to achieve goals, that is, to gain feedback in order to correct actions to achieve a goal. Thus, while both fields must have clear and inter-consistent concepts such as representation, memory, reality, and epistemology (middle), there are more differences than similarities". Diagram © Paul Pangaro, 1990.
  - Maturana, biologist, “Learning is not a process of accumulation of representations of the environment; it is a continuous process of transformation of behavior through continuous change in the capacity of the nervous system to synthesize it. Recall does not depend on the indefinite retention of a structural invariant that represents an entity (an idea, image or symbol),but on the functional ability of the system to create, when certain recurrent demands are given, a behavior that satisfies the recurrent demands or that the observer would class as a reenacting of aprevious one.” (Maturana 1980)
  - Politics of information: Claude Shannon, cyberneticians: content (bits, messages) is necessarily grounded in physical systems and subject to physical limitations (noise, energy, channel constraints)ceases to be the content, gains a body that is a materiality in its connection with the world of physics, engineering and biology
- Reproduction, mass production to mass customization
- Whole Earth Catalog, 1970, new media allowed us to comprehend our closed ecosystem, the birth of ecological movement


### Citations / Theorists  
- Martin Heidegger, technology causes alienation, danger of tech as perpetual process of alienation
- Push back: human is changing, chameleon-like
- Gilbert Simondon, Being and Technology, the technical object is a unit of becoming, it is a Genesis, constant emerging, emerging along with us and through us
- Katherine Hayles, The Condition of Virtuality, 
  - “condition of virtuality” is not an absolute realm of disembodied information, but a cultural, conceptual condition in which we tend to privilege pattern over medium — but one that must always remain attentive to material constraints.

- Start thinking about the topic
	- decide initial topics
	- do the readings, course material and beyond
	- research
		- Who is the author, the context they are in?
		- Who is the publisher
		- Does the author shows bias
		- Quality: Is the information organized well?
		- Coverage: Does it integrate other sources?
		- Currency: The context and time in which it is written, and relevance to today, majority should be current contents
		- Relevance to your topic, what is the system 
- Annotated bibliuography
	- https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/annotated_bibliographies/index.html
	- entry
	- context
	- summary
	- engagement
	- quote
	- different from literature review, bringing the groups of readings and where it sheds insight on

## Links & Resources
- distortion of objects by Matthew Plummer-Fernandez, distorted Mickey Mouse is no longer under same copy right, using the power of technology

>  The program can reconstruct the 3D file from the PNG as well as transform a 3D file into a PNG. The encrypted outcome is so different that you could bypass copyright. Nobody could look at that and see Mickey, though a computer could.
