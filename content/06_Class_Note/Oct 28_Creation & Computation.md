- **Important Terms / References:**  
- **Citations / Theorists:**  

### Computer Vision
David Rokeby (OCAD graduate),  Very nervous system, 1991
16x16 custom camera
	Simple data/interaction can be enough for movements
Camille Utterback, [Text Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_u3sSffS78), 1999
Philip Worthington, Shadow Monsters, 2004
	Tracking the shadow of the hand, instead of hand, which simplified the data
Motus Art, Hard Light, 2024
	Laser projector, makes you feel pushing on the light
	Calibration
	Has its own life, bounce back
OpenCV, 2000, https://opencv.org/get-started/?utm_source=opcv&utm_medium=home
	opensource
Xbox Kinect (360), Microsoft/Primesense 2010
	Open kinetic, open software, fast selling consumer device then
	Skeleton tracking, by camera, 3d projector, calculation inside, plug-in & run
	contribute to mobile robot, but less open source

### Servos, Mechanisms, and 

Jim Henson's
	East end of Toronto, film district?
Servo motors
	simple motors, metal armature, together add more motion
Schulze & Webb, Availabot 2006
Art+com (Germany), Mobility World Expo Shanghai
	Light, mirror, hand
	movement can be light, smell..
Hye Yeon Nam, Hooray
	Shadow, light sensors
	tiny person, different interpretations
	working with repetitive shapes that are responsive
	working with different format, across the wall, long
AATB, non-industrial robots
	"Robots are big servos"
SOSO limited, diffusion choir
	3 iterations
	Linear actuator, opening an umbrella
	interacting with digital birds in the lobby, as the bird hits an umbrella will open
	live simulation of birds, xyz in digital world, match that to physical
	Folding for designers, origami
Responsible Sensing Lab, Shuttercam
	People can control whether they are filmed
	civic context, open source, interaction becomes engaging
Yunchul Kim, CHROMAIII, 2021
	Material bent, to create patterns, plastic mechanism, material property
SpY Studio, Blankets, 2023
	Sound and motion of responsive materials
	motor is hidden
Arthur Ganson, Machine with Artichoke 
	Complex movement, swinging, sad, leaf walking with heavy "weight on shoulders"
	Boston, permanent collection
	+ self-oiling machine

### Computer Vision + Kinetics

Daniel Rozin, Mirrors, 1999
	Physical pixel mirrors
	breakdown of images
	forward/backward/flip(magnetic)
	repairing servos
	pixelate, strip background, 0/255, convert to rotation
Golan levin (Carnegie Melon), Snout 2008 
	Mediation by camera, between machine, human, camera
	details, personalities of the piece, bringing to life
Random International, Audience 2008
	Human as 3D point, the mirror turns to the point direction
Niklas Roy, My Little Piece of Privacy 2010
	Camera, motorized curtain, comedy-like behavior
Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Tape Recordings 2011
	Divide the room to slices, in that slice, turn on the motor
Minimaforms, petting zoo 2012
	Cable and plastic, servos on the top
Tangible Media Group, MIT Media Lab, inform 2013
	linear actuator, remote communication, depth mapping based on the hand to allow virtual play
Getting depth data
Sun Yuan & Peng Yu, Can't help myself 2016
Madeline Gannon, Mimus
	Bring to life with motion only, cv on the ceiling
	who's the most interesting, with lots of movement, go investigate
Thijs Biersteker
	Wield agency, body tracking on ocean trash
	trash can have personality
Bahnaz Farahi, Iridescence 2019
	Sentiment analysis
	didn't like things that force people's unnatural movement, expressions
	person wearing it is not there, just a hunger
Sougwen Chung, Mutations of Presence, 2021
	Collaborative drawing with robots
	cool sequencing
Harry, Ziheng, Mahnoor, Echoes of you
	Puppet, 2 points of movement, head tilt, a bit off the wall, simple white wire, no light needed

### How do computers see?

How to computationally observe and analyze physical activity?

#### WebSerial
Arduino to web browser directly
Serial communication
WebSerial is built into web browsers to communicate to devices attached to serial ports
port.open('Arduino', 9600)
	9600 is communication speed
https://github.com/gohai/p5.webserial

CSV (comma separated values)
	there are line breaks, other methods as well
```
value1 = 100;

value2 = 50;

textToSend = (value1 +","+value2+"\n"); // "100,50"  \n is the character that represents NEW LINE to show the end of the message
```

Prepare Arduino to receive data
https://github.com/DigitalFuturesOCADU/CC2024/blob/main/experiment3/examples/example1_controlLEDs/arduino/serial_read2Vals_LEDbrightness/serial_read2Vals_LEDbrightness.ino


#### ml5.js
Computer vision models for body-tracking
face mesh, body pose, hand

#### Servos
geared DC motor that can turn 180degrees
0 to 180

torque to arm to weight

mechanical gears

## Practice & Studio Work

Use Arduino
Use external webcam
PC is only a brain
Use computer vision
Use servo motors

Challenge the expectation of lightness

Natural interaction
Affordance, invitation to a new interaction
Cable length/management, AV loans, Integrated Media
Find as little data as possible
