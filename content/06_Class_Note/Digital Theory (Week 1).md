# Digital Theory — Week 1


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

### Concepts  

-  McLuhan: What media does to us as subject/human?
> This new way of mediating is changing subjectivity, which applies to all technology (Understanding Media The Extensions of Man, 1964).

> The medium is the message.

> Media as mediation. 
> by Kember & Zylinska

> Thinking with tools is how we mediate the world and are mediated by it
> by Ben Bratton

- AI as media & mediator, how are we mediated by it? we are using tools, but working on it. How it changes how we think? How do we learn teach make in the context AI?

- What is The Stack: an accidental mega structure. We do have agency to design it. The writer is optimistic, in that we have agency to shape our technology, and we have collective responsibility.
- Unplugging is only privileged.

- Speculation as methodology. Speculate what is on the other side. See art, films and be inspired, make
- Even within technological boundaries, we can imagine through speculative design

## Practice & Studio Work

### Writing papers

- Find research theme among key terms provided keep word clusters, clarify relational aspects 
	- Have a log book, refer to it while writing thesis
	- Speculative, future thinking, the task is to question the future to come.

- Timeline
 - Oct 15: No class. Start working on assignment, a theory paper. Can be tangential, not thesis. 

 - Oct 22: Submitting the theory paper topics, get feedback, usually too broad is the problem, be specific, do somethings you are genuinely interested in. Include at least 3 readings from the course.

 - Oct 29: Submit the revised version, coming to the session and orally present it, in a break-up session online, what it is, why you are interested in.

 - Nov 26: Hand in final papers, casually share where did you start and ended as a topic


#### Reading presentations
- 15min presentation and then question sessions. Read the reading twice, extract parts important. Be informative, sharing context (author, why it's important, key idea), few key points (quotes), pulls related design/art work. should have slides, but format is free, with one or two questions in the end.
