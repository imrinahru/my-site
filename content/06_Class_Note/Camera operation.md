- 30fps vs 24fps
	- frame per second
	- films format=24fps
	- youtube format=30fps
	- choose based on the purpose
- when using a new SD card, format it in camera first
- A common guideline is to set **shutter speed = 1 / (2 × frame rate)**
	- At 30 fps → **1/60 sec** shutter speed.
	- This keeps motion blur looking natural.  
	- If you keep 1/30 at 30 fps, the footage may look too blurry; if you go much faster (like 1/500), it may look choppy.
- In video recording, ISO controls the sensor’s sensitivity to light, hence brightness vs. noise
	- adjust so that the brightness is at the desired spot
	- unlike static image, where small ISO might be preferred
- Using a tripod, the plate can stay attached on camera
	- use a 25cent coin to tighten reasonably
	- when attaching, slide the plate in, fix 
	- when detaching, slide the plate out by pressing on the safety lock
- Tripod can be lengthened, leg opening angles can be adjusted at their joints
	- usually just grab open (if its new, a bit tight)
	- a handle that can be turned to change the opening angle, either to wide, or narrower (2 options for this light-weight model)
