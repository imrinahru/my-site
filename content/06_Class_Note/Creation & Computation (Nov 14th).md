# Creation & Computation (Nov 14th) — Week {{week-number}}


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

https://makezine.com/projects/simple-animatronic-eyes/
It also talks about screws and bolts
Components available at [nmrobots.com](http://nmrobots.com/), or:
- **3D printer filament** PLA is fine, but use a good brand because some parts are quite small and fragile. ABS is good for making realistic eyes but not necessary
- **Micro servos, SG90 (6)** [Amazon B0B68NTZ6H](https://www.amazon.com/DIANN-Walking-Helicopter-Airplane-Control/dp/B0B68NTZ6H?tag=makecommunllc-20)
- **Screws, various M2 and M3** OK to use different lengths/head types. [Amazon B098KXZNY6](https://www.amazon.com/Socket-Screws-Assortment-Metric-Threaded/dp/B0D3PX2WWP?tag=makecommunllc-20) 
- **Arduino microcontroller** [Uno](https://www.makershed.com/collections/arduino/products/arduino-uno-rev-4-minima), Nano, Mega, or similar 
- **Servo Driver Board, 16-Channel** [Amazon B00EIB0U7A](https://www.amazon.com/16-Channel-12-bit-Servo-Driver-Interface/dp/B00EIB0U7A?tag=makecommunllc-20)
- **Power supply** around 5V, 4A. [Amazon B0CP7G8Z7R](https://www.amazon.com/Regulated-Switching-Interchangeable-Universal-Electronics/dp/B0CP7G8Z7R?tag=makecommunllc-20) 
- **Corresponding female DC power jack** [Amazon B09H5L3KN5](https://www.amazon.com/LUORNG-Threaded-Connector-Pre-soldered-Waterproof/dp/B09H5L3KN5?tag=makecommunllc-20) 
- **Joystick, 2-axis** [Amazon B00P7QBGD2](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Controller-JoyStick-Breakout-Arduino/dp/B00P7QBGD2?tag=makecommunllc-20)
- **Potentiometer (optional)** [Amazon B019I13X5K](https://www.amazon.com/Uxcell-a15040700ux0380-Terminals-Linear-Potentiometer/dp/B019I13X5K/?tag=makecommunllc-20) 
- **Momentary pushbutton** aka push-to-make switch. Some joysticks have this built in, but it’s easier to control when separate. [Amazon B01CGMP9GY](https://www.amazon.com/DAOKI-Miniature-Momentary-Tactile-Quality/dp/B01CGMP9GY?tag=makecommunllc-20)  
- **Resistor, 10kΩ** [Amazon B01F06T56I](https://www.amazon.com/Projects-25EP51410K0-10K-Resistors-Pack/dp/B01F06T56I?tag=makecommunllc-20)
- **Breadboard jumper wires** for the Arduino. [Amazon B01EV70C78](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-EL-CP-004-Multicolored-Breadboard-arduino/dp/B01EV70C78?tag=makecommunllc-20) 
- **Sandpaper** around 240 grit

- **3D printer**
- **Pin vise hand drill (optional)** useful for adjusting hole sizes if using an older/less capable 3D printer. [Amazon B098CF3VMM](https://www.amazon.com/Vise-Hand-Drill-Jewelry-Making/dp/B098CF3VMM?tag=makecommunllc-20)
- **Screwdriver(s)** to match your screws

Try something other people have tried as a learning process

### Code review
Body tracking points
- Does what you are tracking and how you are tracking it make sense?
- Draft of system diagram that describes the input/output 
	- human with body point, where is the camera, where is the mechanism, what data is fed to the mechanism, can be a flow chart with icons
Mechanisms
- document the mechanism separatelt to show how it works
