# Digital Fabrication (Oct 30th) — Week {{week-number}}


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

Plastic manufacturing 

- Most prevalent: injection moulding
- but the moulding is costly, so need large quatity
- no variation
- that is, mass production
- 3D printing in 80s as a prototyping tool
- but only owned by few big corporations
- RepRap project introduced it to consumer market
	- an academic project at Bath University
	- a 3D printer that can make a 3D computer themselves
	- open-source, accessible to all, easy replication
- Makerbot designed their printer based on RepRap
	- anybody can purchase
- Commercial endeavours as while for industrial prototyping
- Maker & Corporation joined: Stratasys buying makerbot
- Other brands: prusa, bamboo, more competition, different price points
- Prusa founder is one among RepRap
	- Consumers should be able to improve/change the machines
	- which is different from Bamboo
- MakerBean Cafe

Benefits 
- Small scale
- Fast prototyping
- Intricate
- Larger physical size
- more material access: food
- Rapidia Metal Paste Deposition printer @ RP
	- it will shrink, one dimension more than the other
	- printer + keln

Free spirit
- Hinge replacement for xx
- More agency
- Extend the life of whatever is broken
- Improve and modify
- Products that are not meant to be/can hack the world
	- The 3D additivist cookbook
	- free universal construction kit
- 
### 3D scanning

> [!NOTE] Idea
> Scan a food, muffin?

3D laser scanning / LiDAR
Measure the time it takes for a laser beam to come back from reflections
LiDAR: Light Detection And Ranging
Lidar apps: Polycam, Scaniverse
Structure scanner: Monocle

Structured Light Scanning
Uses the distortion of a projected white light pattern to capture
points for registration

Figure out points in space, point-cloud, few scans to line up, then create mesh, then fine-tune with 3D printer
Sculpture and scan
- make things with hands
- use technology
- small pieces can be translated into a bigger digital model
Little Canada, photogrammetry, jpeg data is also mapped on to the model

- Avoid shiny, metallic, gloss, hairy, deforming
	- food, frozen, how to hold in place?

Scaniverse
- LiDAR
- Photogrammetry
- free, dl in any format

Polycam
- quality of scan
- 10 scans, only dl in image/video

Go to edit meshes, cutoff, seal together
Meshmixer

Cloudy day, soft even light, walk all the way around the object at same distance
find a tall stool
or electric turn table with tripod

Splat
- cloud point-> polygons
	- not very accurate representation due to hard lines
- splat create forms by collecting translucent fuzzy blobs in space, better communication of transparency, shape, texture
Scanniverse
- same distance around
- range: 60cm
- scan until red lines disappear
- 2/3 min for scan
- processing happens locally (polycam in their server)
- stl: shape info, a mesh ready to use in mesh mixer (check if its closed)
- obj: shape + texture
- remember to scale it before printing
