# (WIP) W5_Digital Fabrication — Week {{week-number}}


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

3D 
Different types:
- fused demosition modeling (FDM)
	- layers of material extrusion
	- precise heating and cooling
	- max print size
	- either gantry up/down, bed left/right
	- Prusa MK3S+ (250 * 210 * 210)
	- Mini (180 180 180)
	- XL (360 360 360)
		- Print in 5 material at once
	- Bambu Carbon X1 (256 256 256)
		- Print in 4 material at once
		- after-bambu, the price and quality is a game changer, easy use, plug and play, affordable
	- Support material can be added to be bridle
		- an overhang over 45 
	- Solid vs lower density infil
		- standard: 15%
		- big print: bring down the infil 25%
		- key component: increase the infil like 5%
	- Materials
		- PLA: inexpensive, multi-color, env friendly (corn statch..but can't recycle), melt nicely, standard
		- ABS: strong plastic, require temp control, fuse is worse for you
		- PET-G: water bottle, recyclable, temperature more difficult, 
		- composite materials
			- wood composite, can be sanded
			- steel composite, can be sanded, to bring out shine
		- Clay, ceramic print by robotic arm
			- bigger nosel
			- actively keep the material moist
			- research clay printer, needs clay knowledge
			- less about 3D print, more about the material
			- 
	- Affordable, black friday sale! also filament on Amazon
	- less capable of fine details (not true)
	- linear surface texture (not true)
	- Where strength need to be? changes how you want to layer
	- Tinkering, speed improved

- Stereolithography (SLA)
	- Using UV light to cure one layer at a time
	- resin printing
	- no visible layers! very smooth, popsicle
	- tray of liquid resin, bed dipped in, a uv light will cure each layer
	- Formlabs Form4, locked in system, no tinkering
	- Support material needed, generated by slicing soft
	- Wash, alcohol to remove excess resin, bake again, hard sets the model
	- clear resin is very clear
	- dyed, clear coated
	- allows higher detail, popular to print in wax print for mould making, bring to the casting district (jewelry)
		- eg. zipper
		- models of spiders, small format sculpture work
	- not much color
	- flexible/strong
		- dentist create dental quality material
	- resin is more brittle!
	- smaller maximum print size. solid model, can't do infil
	- 


- Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
	- compacted powder
	- Nylon powder
	- Sinter the powder, melt it one layer at a time
	- no support needed
	- Work is supported by powder chamber
	- Can have interlocking pieces
	- Printer (165 165 300)
	- Cleaner
	- No tumbler
	- very slow
	- No color option
	- can print many parts at once, fit in the volume space
	- nylon is a stonger material
	- Porous texture
	- Powder clean-up
	- 
- Binder jet (color)
	- droplets make sandstoned glued together, each layer glued together at the surface, Yong Dundas, Little Canada, scan you and print you. 

- little chunks of prints, reinforced with carbon rod, coated with carbon (?), sanded, painted, 100s dollars
- PETG, translucent->color, FDM printed whip
- [graceleelawrence.com](https://www.graceleelawrence.com/)
- A mold, cast a plaster, required lots of sanding, perfect surdace
- Iris Van Herpen, in white that can be dyed
- Generative design, printed in one go, in one chamber, nervous system

3D modeling
- scale things correctly
- needs to be a closed model
	- virtual model vs. water tight, no holes, not surfaces
- Choose app based on needs
	- precise: Fusion 360, Rhino
- TinkerCad
	- does very well in substruct add primitive shapes
- From Illustrator
	- scale it 
	- smaller than .125, then milling head cannot happen 
	- measuring tool
	- offset path the correct amount
	- pointy areas will lose, just accept, then no change needed
	- import line work as SVG
	- But modification of shape is no longer quite possible, basic editing (might not be the main usage)
	- Black line = holes, white line = surface
	- 
Use a caliber
- help visualize things
