# Digital Fabrication — Week 1


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

### About the instructor

- Print making to fabrication
- 2013, there's less information for creatives on digital fabrication
- Created a website for creatives, to integrate digital fabrications in their process

> I loved the agency that printmaking gave me. It made me feel like a one person factory.

### Concepts

- Increase capacity of making
- laser cutting, 3D printing
- additionally Illustrator and 3D modeling tools (Fusion 360, Blender)
- Algorithms, different 3D modeling engines

> [!NOTE] Algorithmic/generative design
> What are the tools, how to use them? 

- Equipment comes from industrial fabrication, adapted to be smaller, more affordable, in non industrial places
- Designing, digital designing and output, in between are hard works
	- in digital designing, artwork is translated into instructions.
	- G code (the primary programming language for Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines and 3D printers), tells machine where to go
- Potential variable is the material you work with, machine can be consistent over and over again
- Make sure to finetune instructions: make sure instructions are understandable to machines.
- It helps to understand the machine, its limitations, parameters.
- Think about creating 3D vector as 1st stage, 
2nd stage is outputting, the processes can be totally divided (and done by different people/outsource)
- Create swatches, tests: Digital fab sampler, learn to adjust file to different machines
	Nov 20th, design a vector shape as basis for samplers, to create laser/waterjet/cnc mill/vinyl cut/3D print/3D scan
- Danger in over-simplifying the technology, and make it a black box. It becomes just keychain machines, don't examine them as medium or possibilities. Stay in shallow end of what they are capable of, as we can be satisfied with the most basic output.

### Practices
[[#^de1d62]]
- 100 grit sand paper, a sanding sponge or a nail file
- Methalyne Chloride or Rez-n-bond
- Natural-hair paintbrush
- Clamps

- Digital knitting, Create Plus, design pixels and put in the machine

### Important Terms / References  
- Additive production
- Subtractive production
- Laser cut 
	Materials: Plywood/Acryric
- Waterjet cutter
	Some of the materials: steel
	Create a 4"x4" file for this exercise
	Cannot do design motif on the surface
- CNC mill
	Some of the materials: cork, wood, form
	Create a 4"x4" file for this exercise
	Can be 2D or 3D, it cannot have any undercut (no mushroom)
- 3D printing
	Some of the materials: wood filament, PLA (polylactic acid)
	- Polyjet printer, jets liquid photopolymer resin, cures with UV, very high resolution
	- Resin printer (SLA/DLP/LCD), cures liquid resin layer by layer, high resolution
	- FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling, extrudes thermoplastic filament layer by layer, lower resolution
- 3D scanning
- Vinyl cutting, at XFab
- CAD: Computer Aided Design, Translating design to digital format
- CAM: Computer Aided Manufacturing, uses CAD models to create toolpaths for machines to follow


### Citations / Theorists

- Paulo Bilstein, at Stanford University, "Keychain syndrome". Disproportionate payoff in staying at the minimum effort. The syndrome stops us thinking about this as a medium, encourage artists to push past the basic minimum

## Practice & Studio Work
- **Exercises / Demos:**  
  - key chain
	  Push the limit of the function of a keychain
	  Bag charm that carry something?
	  Strange and fun


> [!NOTE] Idea
> Keychain that clings onto everything

  - sampler (most semester to work through)
  - independent study (adapt to own interest, pitch the project, smaller component of a bigger work, that intructor can support in class)
