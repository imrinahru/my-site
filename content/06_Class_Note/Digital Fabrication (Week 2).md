# Digital Fabrication — Week 2


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

### Concepts: About Laser Cutting

#### Mechanism
process called light amplification. Laser tube, turn electrons to laser beam, technology from 60s, CO2 is used the most, laser can move around and burn, air current can move debris along side.
Focal distance need to be adjusted, trotec is manual

#### Spec
Check:
- Power: watts
- Laser type: 
	- CO2, can't do metal
	- Fibre, metal ok
- Bed size

#### Settings
- File size in inches
- Cutting (Red stroke, 0.01pt)
- Rastering (Black fill)
- Linear engraving (Blue stroke, 0.01pt)

#### Techniques
- Raster vs Vector
- Rastering, 65min
- Linear engraving, 11min, but no control on line thickness

Job control
- Setting power and speed depending on material 
- Can work with silk, wood, only surface etc, very flexible


Materials
- Plywood, flat, predictable (not construction level)
- Leather (no fake leather, no PVC)
- Felt (can be synthetic, natural)
- Wood
- Cork
- Linorium (rastering, engraving)
- Hardwood
- MDF (garbage material, don't use if possible)
- Acrylic
- Cardboard (no double wall)
- heat can hold up, be sure to think about accumulating heat

Illustrator
- set the size of material, in inch, RGB
- Have ruler, command R, view, ruler, hide/show rule
- Have guide, click and drag
- Nothing too close to the edge 1/4 inch
- 1/8 inch apart
- Selecting obj, alt, shows distance
- Paint brush and types, turn to outline, then use pathfinder to merge them (one bigger block)
- Expand patterns, turn into fills and blank spaces

Kerf
- using object-> path-> offset path tool

- Mirror acrylic for a fine installation

- Physical overlay effect

- Acrylic: Keep protective paper on, rastering through paper, add colors in

- Use real-world objects, powerful image

- For fabrics, iron and stick on a board, burn, scorching, weight how to achieve the best result, dye cutting might be better
