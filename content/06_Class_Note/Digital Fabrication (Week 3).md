## Lecture & Discussion Notes

### Laser Cutting & Materials


- **Main Concepts:**  
  - Laser cutting
  - Waterjet cutting
	  - "sanding" the material
	  - metal, stone, thicker plastics
	  - can't do detailed work
	  - significant material loss

How 
- CNC milling
  - large scale, thick cutting
  - polycarbonate
  - interior sharp corners
  - 2D plus 3D
- Acrylic
	- extruded
	- casted (more expensive, with protective paper)
	- apply masking tape, you can not overlap the tap at all
	- painter's tape, thicker masking tape
	- vino transfer tape
	- acrylic can't be sanded
- Wood 
	- use masking tape technique
	- there will be less fire mark
	- but can sand


- **Raster & Vector:**
    - Different grayscale values → different depths.
    - Contrast, speed, and power settings affect engraving depth.
- **Environmental Considerations:**
    - **MDF:** Made of sawdust + glue, not recyclable.
    - **Plywood:** Can be reused, turned into chips.
    - **Acrylic:** Requires special recycling, costly.
    - **Paper:** Environmentally friendly option.
- **Design & Cutting Tips:**
    - Use **stencil fonts** for clean cuts.
    - Convert images to vector in Illustrator: _Image Trace → Path → Offset Path_.
    - Kerf testing: check how much material is lost, adjust design.
    - Finger joints: [makercase.com](https://www.makercase.com/) for templates.
    - Edge lighting effects possible in acrylic (e.g., _partisans.com_).
    - Heat forming:
        - Heat gun, ovens, or strip benders.          
        - 1/8" or 1/16" easier to shape; 1/4" much harder.
        - Use gloves, heat evenly for cleaner finish
    - Kerf cuts for flexibility in plywood; less effective in plastic.

### Acrylic & Plastic Work

- **Material Properties:**
    - Mirror acrylic: with or without mirror film. 
    - Plastic can be dyed (boil + soak method).
    - Question: Can acrylic be melted + reshaped sustainably?
      - No
- **Fabrication Techniques:**
    - Polyester resin casting → custom sheets possible.
    - Heat forming for hooks/shapes → need proper tools for clean edges.
    - Adhesives: gel medium, crazy glue, resin bond (like acetone, in nail polish remover)

### CNC Milling & Waterjet Cutting

- **Waterjet Cutter:**
    - Bed size: 60" × 60".
    - Materials: stone, steel, glass..
    - Colors:
        - Green = center line
        - Blue = inside cut
        - Red = outside cut
    - Minimum size consideration to avoid material loss.
- **CNC Milling:**
	- Techno CNC LC Series 4896
		- 42 * 96"
	- Techno CNC HDII Tabletop
		- 20 * 30"
	- axis of the mill
		- 3 axis: up/down, side to side, back/forth
		- can't cut at an angle/tilt
    - Materials: plywood, corian, urethane, hardwood, rigid foam.
    - Both 2D + 3D cutting: pockets, through-cuts, double-sided milling.
    - No undercut
    - ![[Pasted image 20251003173908.png]]![[Pasted image 20251003173857.png]]
    - ![[Pasted image 20251003174017.png]]
	- Create a digital version of the material stock and design from there, add tabs
    - Use “onion skin” technique for final thin layer before xacto cutting, an alternative to traditional tabs
    - No sharp interior corner cuts, be aware of the minimum radius it can create
    - ![[Pasted image 20251003172538.png]]
    - **Dog bone joinery** for square corners.
    - ![[Pasted image 20251003172655.png]]
    - ![[Pasted image 20251003172635.png]]
	- Add **tabs** to prevent pieces from moving.
    - Finishes: sandblasting for textures.
    - Toolheads: multiple options for different cuts.

Examples:
- [Bar Raval](https://guide.michelin.com/ca/en/ontario/toronto/restaurant/bar-raval) example: one giant 3D model → sliced → assembled.
