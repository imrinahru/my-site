# (WIP) W4_Digital Theory — Week 4

## Readings






## Lecture & Discussion Notes
- **Main Concepts:**  
  - Fibre optic cables, servers, storage, computing power, infra that contributes to "clouds" to function
  - Be aware of the metaphor of the "cloud", it is terraforming, it is changing minerals/mining, landscape, it is resource heavy, appetite for water, cheap energy, easy regulation, it is political, remote landscape, 
  - Colonization process, we are paying for and feeding into this process, they are not visible and remote
  - Exaggerated by AI servers, depletes water, needs so much cooling
  - Within the clouds, there are platforms, we participate the cloud through platforms, a group of technologies that are used as a base upon which other applications are developed
  - Interface is required for users to access the platforms, the value of a platform is often associated with its interface and usability
  - "An interface is any point of contact between 2 complex systems that governs the conditions of exchange between those systems" (The Stack)
  - ARPAnet (direct predecessor of Internet) contributed to the user interface: Graphic User Interface, universal visual language
  - Internet: shaped new realities, a new spatial relationship in time and space
	  - speed
	  - connectivity
	  - interconnectivity
	  - Does the internet dream of itself: Lo And Behold, Reveries of the Connected World (Werner Herzog, documentaries)
		  - is there a collective consciousness? own agency?
		  - connectivity allows coordinated scientific opportunities
		  - Extremes: people who are paranoid by the Internet vs. technofascism
	  - Place of wonder and dark that requires critical inquiry
- Data as info, image, maps, data is not neutral, data is a resource
- Platforms collect and monetize data, it is not transparent, I seldom know what our data is used, platforms are grounded in material and labor realities, clickworkers in Philippines, data center of the Arctic, geopolitics
	- State and market as the same time (Bratton)
	- machines is politic, platforms are not technical models, but institutional models
	- subcultures, arabspring, relied on social media to communicate, but there is control, some communication is deleted, although we use Internet to create community, there is the problem with over-reliance, can we subvert the platform, can a community, activism happen there? Can we have counterpoints to build a secondary system, a robust backup.
	- Thoughts: highly knowledgeable people on the contrary used physical keys, such as for metamask etc
- attention / emotional economy
- zero-thinking interaction design (Adam Greenfield) is a form of governance that increases the risks people need to bear in face of black-boxed system, "serious security risks..driven by commercial decision" (p.44)
	- giving up our thinking, only exaggerated by AI
- Unfitbits
- Common people, Black Mirror season7, episode 1
	- becoming slaves to the tools
- **Important Terms / References:**  
- 
  -  
- **Citations / Theorists:**  
  - Design politics, Kurgan, Laura. “Representation and the Necessity of Interpretation”. Close up at a Distance. Zone Books New York 2013. Pg19-36
  - Galloway, Alex. “The Unworkable Interface”. The Interface Effect. Polity Press. 2012 (preface)
	  - Cybernetics: feedback loop
	  - interface: zones of interaction that mediate between 2 different realities
	  - have autonomy separate from 2 systems
	  - mediation: defines limits and possibilities, is it deliberate?
	  - Internet, network vitality, as complex as neuro-system, always shifting, stimulated
  - Casey Reas, Kurgan 34, what is our vision? how do we perceive the world? limited/more information can blur the actual image, what is the best scale? what is the vantage point?
	  - pulls images from the internet, it became a pixel, a color, a pattern, critiquing the mass data
	  - data is always translated into decipherable scale, there is no raw data, the view can be distancing, or emerged
- Diagrams of Power and Performing by Patricio Davila
- Vladan Joler, New Extractivism
	- https://opensecret.kw-berlin.de/de/events/open-secret-the-new-extractivism-and-escaping-the-clearnet/
	- allegory, showing something that is hidden
	- Deluze, divisuals
		- condividuals
	- regulatory process allows current data extraction, we all signed up to this, but there should have been an alternative
- Adam Greenfield, Head of Design Nokia
