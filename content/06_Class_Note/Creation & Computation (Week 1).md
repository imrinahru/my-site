# Creation & Computation — Week 1

## Lecture & Discussion Notes

-  The course is about #electronics, #programs, #digitalfabrication, #screen, #physical, #materiality, #interaction, #kinetics, and #installation, #documentation. Learning the landscape and assessing various tools. pairing tools with ideas. Not solutions, products, but asking questions.
- **Transform super generic technology to a very specific interaction**

---
## Practice & Studio Work 
### Instruction

- 4 assignments, each 3 week, 6 class sessions. At the 5th session, critique, at the 6th, modify and record
- Quick iteration, be limber
- How to tell people about a project when that person is not there? How to record?
- Find a prime time, set a cadence for that to work on, it's a full-time commitment
- Communicate for late work. Will try to keep within the group and flow, but can modify.
- Scoping: calibrate expectation vs timeline. It's ok that some Ideas might be left behind. Think what can be get done well within this time frame. Try a small version of an idea.
- Cite sources. Random images need to cited. Otherwise it's plagiarism. 
- GAI is working for you, not you working for it, then it's ok. Talk to instructors, they will help to maximize learning.

### 1st Assignment: Pressure

- Materials
	- touch pad
	- card board
	- electrical components (hidden)

- Timeline
	- Sep 23rd Tue, in-class exhibition
	- Sep 25th Thu, documentation

### Sensing pressure
- Using force sensitive resister, or
- Building sensors from scratch

### Displaying pressure
- How to make a smart cardboard?
- What force and interaction?
- Experiment with physical patterning, digital pattering, cardboard shapes

### Requirements
- Single-color LEDs (5V or lower) embedded in cardboard
- Pressure exerted by human bodies
- Components are enclosed
- Write your code, can use AI to suggest or learn from. Ask "How does this work.."
- Write a code narrative, explain what the code is doing

But components mainly come from [adfruit](https://www.adafruit.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooJJjcVLeShnhHmY_-psMhk4IMxp4pExg9A_BUIdGsnmIzch6Zo), a smaller company in NY, documentation is friendly, components are good quality. At each component page data sheets and links to learning materials can be found.
