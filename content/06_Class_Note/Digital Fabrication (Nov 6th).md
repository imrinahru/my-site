Machines that trace vector lines, working with adhesive vinyl, a stretchy plastic that is adhesive on the back.
roots from plotters, printing clothing patterns, architectural patterns, with a set width but unlimited length
Store display, stickers, iron-on tshirt

artboard within the size of the material
select everything->object->compound path->make
save as svg
Transfer tape
tape the cut onto a flat tape, 
slowly laydown the tape all across
Use credit card to press down
peel off the backing paper
Transfer to another clean surface
Use a card to stick the vinyl surface 
Very steep angle to peel off

New project, new project
Upload image (svg)
canvas in cm, refer with the paper map
The compound path can be dragged across
Save
material load type: On mat
material size: 12 by 12
connect to the machine


Use iron-on vinyl for
