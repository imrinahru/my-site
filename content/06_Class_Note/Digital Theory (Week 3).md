## Lecture & Discussion Notes

### Main Concepts

- **Digesting readings efficiently**: Use annotated bibliographies, highlight key quotes, extract main ideas.
    
- **Developing arguments**:
    
    - Highlight tensions (positive/negative)
        
    - Compare and contrast viewpoints
        
    - Trace historical evolution of technologies
        
    - Reveal novel observations and unexpected connections
        
    - Include subjective experiences where relevant
        
- **Voice and perspective**: Reflect on which ideas resonate personally; how to respond critically.
    
- **Writing style**: Borrow techniques from creative writing for clarity and engagement in theoretical or curatorial texts.

### Key Terms & References

- **Network**: Determines parameters of control; exposes invisible infrastructures.
    
    - Early internet as decentralization project → now dominated by hyper-nodes and corporate control.
        
- **Governance**: Laws, agreements, and frameworks shaping digital infrastructures.
    
- **Mechanic Turk (18th c.)**: Chess-playing automaton with hidden human → metaphor for automation and hidden labor.
    
- **Deleuze**: Societies of control emerge under hyper-networked conditions.
    
- **Easterling**: Urban surveillance and _infoscapes_ as invisible architectures of power.
    
- **Carl Linnaeus**: Taxonomy → early system of classification → precursor to data visualization.
    
- **Lovink**: Networks reshape the social; no untouched spaces remain; uneven access becomes structural.
    
- **Bratton’s Stack**:
    
    - _User, Interface, Address, City, Cloud, Earth_ → interconnected layers shaping digital identity and participation.
        
    - Critique: Human-centered design alone is insufficient; needs broader socio-technical critique.
        
- **Kate Crawford, _Atlas of AI_**: Politics of classification in AI; worked with Trevor Paglen on [Training Humans](https://www.fondazioneprada.org/project/training-humans/?lang=en).

## Reflection & Connections

- Digital infrastructures embed political, social, and historical forces.
    
- Networks are not neutral; they produce both opportunities (communication, connection) and constraints (control, surveillance).
    
- Theories like _The Stack_ help visualize how multiple layers—technical, social, ecological—interact in shaping digital realities.
    

---

## To-Do & Follow-up

- Complete reading notes for Han & Samman.
    
- Explore _Atlas of AI_ case studies on classification politics.
    
- Consider applying creative writing techniques to next theory response.

# (WIP) W3_Digital Theory — Week 3


## Lecture & Discussion Notes
- **Main Concepts:**  
  -  Annotated bibliography, quickly digest the reading, maybe some quotes
  -  Glossary
  - Developing an argument
	  - negative / positive, highlights complexity, or
	  - compare and contrast, or
	  - evolution, within a context, how a technology is embedded, or
	  - reveal, novel observation
	  - finding connections, the way of bringing together 
	  - add subjective experience,
	  - an event can be a starting point
  - What is my voice? which things affected you?
  - https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/
  - Apply creative writing to curatorial writing as well
  - Clarity is difficult, how to give it to many ideas
- **Important Terms / References:**  
  -  Network: every network determines a parameter of control, see the invisible structure
  - Internet, initially: distributed networks, decolonization project, now, through corporate drive, hypernodes suck up all

  - Governance: process of governing, imposes structure, law, agreements
  - Mechanic turks, 18 century, little man is behind the chess-playing machine
- **Citations / Theorists:**  
  - Deleuze, our hyper-network times have resulted in societies of control
  - Esaterling, urban surveillance, the space we're swimming in, is also a structure, infoscapes, the invisible networks
  - Carl Linnaeus (Taxonomy)-> data visualization
  - Lovink, what are the impacts of network on the social, we as social creatures. "at some point the social lost its historical role and imploded into the media", we can simultaneously habit separate world? No. There is no untouched lands. The network is the actual shape of the social, uneven access becomes another layer of structure.
  - Bratton, the Stack is creating our identity in the world, cannot pull something out, all interconnected
	  - User (people, AI bots, sensors, algorithms)
	  - Interface (to participate, the interface becomes easy to use, universal, that becomes hyper-nodes)
		  - so doing human-centered design alone is not enough ==Critique of Human centered AI through social lens==
	  - Address (whereabouts)
	  - City (infoscape)
	  - Cloud (servers, connections)
	  - Earth
  - Kate Crawford's Atlas of AI, the politics of classification is a core practice in artificial intelligence
	  - with [Trevor Paglen](https://paglen.studio/) worked on imagenet

they define directly or indirectly what we can or cannot do they are both cools and discursive frames they are instituted as an order of discourse and embodiment of the discipline power of the platform
