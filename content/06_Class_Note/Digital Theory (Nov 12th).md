# Digital Theory (Nov 12th) — Week {{week-number}}


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

https://arts.cern/
Matter as having agency, it is wandering, emerging, has imagination.

dematerialization
free of physical substance

immaterial
having no material body/form

We have interest for translating everything into digitals, but are they really immaterial?

hypermaterial
transcend natural/organic constraints of a material
AI is moving to hypermaterial?

Speculative realism
no longer centers the human
think about reality beyond human experience and human perception
problem with correlationism, always related to human
movement emerged in the 2000, rejecting anthropocentrism, as vs Kant
we can only know the relationship between thought and being, not being itself

Computing machine now exists outside cognitive control, more hidden
before there was very physical interaction

Vibrant Matter, Jane Bennett
The material world is actually shaping us
Guiding question; How would political responses to p

The digital and the emergence of the connectivity infra relies heavily on material substances

Allahyari and Rourke
> In March 2015 Allahyari and Rourke released The 3D Additivist Manifesto, a call to push additive manufacturing technologies to their absolute limits and beyond, into the realm of the speculative, the provocative and the weird. They then issued a call for submissions for a radical Cookbook of blueprints, designs, 3D-printing templates, and essays on the topics raised by their Manifesto.
> 
> The resulting 3D Additivist Cookbook - made up of imaginative, provocative works from over 100 world-leading artists, activists and theorists - was published on December 2nd 2016 and can be downloaded for free at: http://additivism.org/cookbook
> 
> #Additivism considers the 3D printer as a profound metaphor for our times. A technology for channelling creative endeavour, through digital processes, into the layering of raw matter excavated from ancient geological eras. Considered as a tool for art, design and engineering, and gesturing towards a forthcoming era of synthetic chemistry and biological augmentation, 3D fabrication technologies are already a site of common exchange between disciplines and forms of materiality. 3D fabrication can be thought of as the critical framework of #Additivism: a movement that aims to disrupt material, social, computational, and metaphysical realities through provocation, collaboration, and ‘weird’ / science fictional thinking.
> 
> #Additivism is essential for accelerating the emergence and encounter with The Radical Outside.
> 
> The 3D Additivist Manifesto was created by Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke, with sound design by Andrea Young.
