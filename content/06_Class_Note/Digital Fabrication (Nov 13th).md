# Digital Fabrication (Nov 13th) — Week {{week-number}}


## Lecture & Discussion Notes

Abundance Intelligence (AI)
Building AI based on a different knowledge system

Parametric Design
Iris Von Herpen
Fusion 360 is parametric
Grasshopper
geometry + node programming
eg. crv to divide function 

Generative design
algorithms to create a variety of possible forms
4 legs, flat surface
Tutorial by Dr. Ahmad

in fusion generative design
enter physics information, weight to carry, size, other constraints
what geometry to preserve
obstacles
load case: the forces 

> [!NOTE]
> Design something that is only essential for material saving
> 

Bathsheba Grossman
mathematical expressions

ChatGPT: Turn into a plastic toy/gold charm..

[Meshy](https://www.meshy.ai/): text to 3D

### Glitches

The idea of glitch has changed.
Less hiccups and mistakes
Understand the machine and ability of trouble shoot is important
Also open up the possibility to lean into giving up some control
Unintentional collaboration

eg. Program degradation
less filament is used as the print process goes

## Practice & Studio Work
- **Exercises / Demos:**  
- **Process Documentation (sketches, images, links):**  
- **Technical Notes (software, materials, tools):**  

---

## Critique & Feedback
- **Instructor Feedback:**  
- **Peer Feedback:**  

---

## Reflection & Connections

- Maybe AI create better when some quality input is fed into the model. So it might work better with a specific unique sketch.
